      <p>Hi! My name is Charles Drake Jr. and I am a Junior at Michigan State University majoring in Games and Interactive Media with a focus in Game Development. This is my portfolio and in it you will see my progress as I learn how to code. The different classes that I have taken are CSE 231 at Michigan State University which focuses on the coding language Python. Currently, I am taking CSE 232 which is the next class after CSE 231 that focuses on the coding language C++. This portfolio shows off my growth as the semester continues as I learned Python and become more proficient in C++, by showing the different projects and assignments that range from over a year of classes.</p>
      <p>I found myself choosing Games and Interactive Media for my major due to the immense amout of video games I find myself enjoying. I love to play games of all different types ranging from strategy to action and everything in between. Currently I am playing a lot of Overwatch due to it being my favorite game at the moment.</p>

      <p>Some games the are also my favorite are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assassin's Creed Rogue</li>
          <li>Minecraft</li>
          <li>Elden Ring</li>
          <li>God of War</li>
        </ul>
